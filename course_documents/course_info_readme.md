# Welcome and Intro to Constraint Programming

## The Plan
### Topics
There is some possible wiggle here, but the current plan is:
- Combinatorial optimisation and decision problems
- Intro to CP and CSP
- Modelling problems as CP in MiniZinc
- Global and special constraints
- Arc consistency and search approaches for CP
- Other solvers for combinatorial problems
- Combinatorial search for games
- Cool CP stuff from Ciaran

### Assessment
This course is coursework-only.  There is thus a lot of coursework, so you will need to manage things fairly carefully. 

We are planning:

- Assignment 1: MiniZinc modelling assignment
    - Relatively simple problem, focus on a correct model
    - 15% of grade, due Tuesday 15 October
- Multiple choice Moodle quizzes
    - Total 15%, spread throughout semester
- Assignment 2: MiniZinc modelling assignment
    - A more complex problem, correctness and efficiency needed
    - 20% of grade, due Tuesday 12 November
- A research poster with presentation (50%)
    - 50% of grade, due Tuesday 26 November, poster day(s) in following week

All assessments are due by 4:30 pm on the day they are due.  Some will be automatically marked, some band-marked.  

### Weekly Sessions

Teaching is on Wednesdays from 9-11 and 13-14 in Boyd Orr.  I'm planning to use the morning session for material, and the afternoon for Q&A, working on problems, etc.  

If the room has the infrastructure I'll record, but I cannot promise this will always work.  


## Expectations
### Of me
- be a reasonable human being
- be as transparent and clear as possible with material and assessment methods
- be as prepared as I can
    - but please be generous - I try to run the course reasonably interactively
- respond to contact within two weekdays unless I am away/sick/etc
    - sometimes this might be to ask you to save the question for a Wednesday session
- give feedback within the School's standard timeframe

### Of you
- be a reasonable human being
- engage with the material regularly
- attend sessions when you can 
    - please don't attend if you are unwell
- try to bring questions to our Wednesday sessions
- manage your time over the semester
