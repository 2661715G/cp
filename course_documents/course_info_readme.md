# Welcome and Intro to Constraint Programming

## The Plan
### Topics
There is some possible wiggle here, but the current plan is:
- Combinatorial optimisation and decision problems
- Intro to CP and CSP
- Modelling problems as CP in MiniZinc
- Special types of constraints
- Arc consistency and search approaches for CP
- Other solvers for combinatorial problems
- Heuristics
- Cool CP stuff from Ciaran

### Assessment
This course is coursework-only - please let me know how this goes for you!

We are planning four categories of assessment:
- Assignment 1: MiniZinc modelling assignment - automated marking 
    - 15% of grade, due Tuesday 10 October
- Multiple choice Moodle quizzes - automated marking
    - Total 10%, spread throughout semester 
- Assignment 2: A research poster with presentation (40%)
    - 40% of grade, due Monday 13th November - poster presentations to follow
- Assignment 3: A choice of two options:
    - Comparing different solving approaches on the same problem (coding, testing, plotting)
    - 7-minute video explaining one of a list of topics with a demo/example
    - in both cases 35% of grade, due at the end of semester


### Weekly Sessions

Teaching is on Wednesdays from 9-11 and 13-14 in Turnbull 301.  I'm planning to use the morning session for material, and the afternoon for Q&A, working on problems, etc.  

If the room has the infrastructure I'll record, but I cannot promise this will always work.  


## Expectations
### Of me
- be a reasonable human being
- be as transparent and clear as possible with material and assessment methods
- be as prepared as I can
    - but please be generous - this is a course reboot
- respond to contact within two weekdays unless I am away/sick/etc
    - sometimes this might be to ask you to save the question for a Wednesday session
- give feedback within the School's standard timeframe

### Of you
- be a reasonable human being
- engage with the material regularly
- attend sessions when you can 
    - please don't attend if you are unwell
- try to bring questions to our Wednesday sessions
- manage your time over the semester
