# CP 2023 Poster Marking Weighting

This is a marking weighting for CP 2023's research poster and associated question.  The mark will be given as a band grade, using the university's standard marking scheme.  The weighting is to give you an idea of how much weight is given to the poster content, presentation, and the live question.  


## Poster: 90\% marks
- Content (70\% marks): 
Should include:
    - Introduction to Problem
    - Results discussion
    - Relationship to wider field
    - Concluding thoughts
- Presentation (20\%):
    - Layout
    - Readability
    - Language (grammar, etc)


## Question-answer on poster day: 10\%
- when grading take into account:
    - did student understand question, clarify if needed?
    - is the answer logical and thoughtful?
    - if the student doesn't know the answer, they may conjecture thoughtfully so long as they make this clear.  
    - is the answer concise, fitting within a 2-minute window?


If you complete a pair poster, you will have a common mark with your partner for the Poster Presentation section, and the Poster Content: Introduction, Relationship to wider field and Concluding thoughts sections, but your Results discussion and Question-answer will be graded individually.
