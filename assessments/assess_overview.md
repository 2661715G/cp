Note: draft only, not authoritative yet.

CP 2022 is a coursework-only course; that is, we have no exam.  

We are planning four categories of assessment:
- Assignment 1: MiniZinc modelling assignment - automated marking 
    - 10% of grade, due Tuesday 11 October
- Multiple choice Moodle quizzes - automated marking
    - Total 20%, spread throughout semester 
- Assignment 2: A choice of two options:
    - Comparing different solving approaches on the same problem (coding, testing, plotting)
    - 5-minute video explaining one of a list of topics with a demo/example
    - in both cases 20% of grade, due Tuesday 8th November
- A research poster with presentation (50%)
    - 50% of grade, due on poster day in last week of semester


I (Jess) will give you as much notice as I can of details, including marking schemes where possible.  Some of our assessments will be automatically-marked.  

As details become available they will appear here within the appropriate folders.
