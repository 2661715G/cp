Note: draft only, not authoritative yet.

CP 2023 is a coursework-only course; that is, we have no exam.  

We are planning four categories of assessment:
- Assignment 1: MiniZinc modelling assignment - automated marking 
    - 15% of grade, due Tuesday 10 October
- Multiple choice Moodle quizzes - automated marking
    - Total 10%, spread throughout semester 
- Assignment 2: A choice of two options:
    - Comparing different solving approaches on the same problem (coding, testing, plotting)
    - 7-minute video explaining one of a list of topics with a demo/example
    - in both cases 35% of grade, due Tuesday 14th November
- A research poster with presentation (40%)
    - 40% of grade, due near end of semester, presentations at poster day likely optional - TBD


I (Jess) will give you as much notice as I can of details, including marking schemes where possible.  Some of our assessments will be automatically-marked.  

As details become available they will appear here within the appropriate folders.
