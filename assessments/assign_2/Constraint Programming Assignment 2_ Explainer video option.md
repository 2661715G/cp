# Constraint Programming Assignment 2: Explainer video option

This assignment is worth 20% of your final grade, and is marked out of 40 marks.  It must be submitted on Moodle by 4:30 pm on Tuesday 8th November.  

If you choose the explainer option you must produce a **maximum 7-minute** video explaining one of the concepts on the list below.  

You video should include a worked example of the concept you are describing, and mention how it links to what we have mentioned in class.  

### Learning with your peers
It is perfectly fine if multiple students choose the same topic to create an explainer on, and you may help each other in understanding the topic and sourcing papers, textbooks, etc.  If you do this, please include an acknowledgement of the other students you worked with in your video.  

The video itself and the content in it **must be your own work**.  If there is any doubt about this (for example, if there are two very similar videos) I may ask you to talk to me about the topic in person so that I can verify that the video is your own work, and that you understand the topic.  Please don't be alarmed if this happens.  

## Topics
You may choose any of the below topics for your 7-minute video.  I have divided them into more CP-focussed topics and those concerned mainly with other modelling or solver tehcniques.  In some cases I give a starting reference but in most cases a web search will be sufficient to get you started.  In many cases the Handbook of Constraint Programming (http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~pat/cpM/papers/CP_Handbook-20060315-final.pdf) may be a good place to look.  

### More CP-focussed
- the cycle-cutset method (e.g. in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004370290900463)
- directional consistency
- partial arc consistency (AC-1/4, AC-1/3, AC-1/2)
- partial constraint satisfaction (e.g. in https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/89-1/Papers/044.pdf)
- encoding CSPs into SAT so we can use a SAT solver - 'direct encoding' (e.g. http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/wcp00.pdf)
- encoding CSPs into SAT so we can use a SAT solver - 'log encoding' (e.g. http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/wcp00.pdf)
- encoding CSPs into SAT so we can use a SAT solver - 'support encoding' (e.g. https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.64.435&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
- common subexpression elimination (CSE) (e.g as used by the Saville Row tool in https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/pwn503/CP2014-accse.pdf)

### Other solvers
- The branch-and-cut (using cutting planes) method for solving integer programs
- The integrality gap between a relaxation and its original IP and this gap's relationship to approximation algorithms
- satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) as an approach to CSP solving
- Conflict-driven clause learning (as related to SAT solvers)
- Duality based techniques for MIP solvers
- The PPSZ algorithm https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1066100.1066101

## Marking Scheme
Recall that this assignment is marked out of **40 total marks**

- General clarity of presentation: **10 marks**
    - Is the explainer well-organised with logical flow?
    - Is there appropriate use of images, graphics, diagrams
    - Is it possible to understand the verbal explanation (appropriate volume, good planning of what is said)?
    - Is the pace of the presentation good (students often rush at the end - try to avoid this!)?
- Describing the concept: **10 marks**
    - Is the definition or description of the concept/approach clear? Is intuition given?
    - Are all acronyms or technical terms described?
    - is it clear what motivates the approach, why it is needed or when?
    - Is it clear that the student understands the approach/concept/algorithm?
- Worked example: **15 marks**
    - Is there a clear example of the concept/algorithm/approach?
    - Does the example show input, steps of concept/approach/algorithm and result?
    - Does the example show the important characteristics of the concept/approach/algorithm?
    - Is there suitable use of text/slides/diagram/video to demonstrate the example?
- Linkage to course material (and/or other CP concepts): **5 marks**
    - Is there mention of any topics we discussed within the course (up to and including Wednesday 19th November) that are related to the topic of the video?
    - Is it clear what the relationship is?  For example, a student might point out where their topic improves on something we discussed, or if they are useful in different circumstances?



### Bonus 2 marks - CP topic meme
- Up to 2 bonus marks are available for including a meme about your topic with the video.  You may either submit it separately or within your video (if it's within the video maybe label, I'm not very cool so I might miss it).  Picture, video, gif, I don't mind.
- You can get up to 2 extra bonus marks for this extra bit, though your total mark is capped at 40 marks.  For example: even if with bonus marks your mark was 42 marks, you would only get a final grade of 40 marks.
